\title{Forward implementation of Radiative Transfer Models}
\usage{
fRTM(fm = rho + tau ~ prospect5 + foursail, pars = NULL,
  wl = 400:2500)
}
\arguments{
\item{pars}{a list of _named_ parameter vectors for all models.
The parameter list for a model call as rho ~ prospect + foursail
therefore contains two named vectors the first with parameters for
prospect and the second with parameters for foursail 
if left empty default parameters are generated}

\item{wl}{wavelengths (in nm) add only if
certain wavelengths are required as output.
Input is expected to integers between 400 and 2500, or will 
be forced to be an integer. Integers outside the 400:2500 range
will not be returned.}

\item{formula}{A formula specifying which rtm to run}
}
